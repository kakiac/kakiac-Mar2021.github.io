I am a **computational social scientist** and **Senior Researcher** in the [ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/business-and-local-government-data), at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk). My research is driven by my fascination with all kinds of data (big/small, text/number/images) and how it can help us better understand ourselves and our society and how data can be used to improve resilience, maximise accountability and trust and reduce inequalities. Projects I work on leverage current technologies in machine learning, natural language processing and experimental behavioral study to describe the mechanisms for digital transformation in communities, businesses and the public sector and how data can be used as an enabler of a fairer, more transparent and accountable society.

<!-- I research legislative politics/legislative institutions with a focus on the European Union. My interests include political negotiations such as the infamous early agreement system in the European Union and its consequences for representation and political power. My work also relates to the determinants of bargaining failure, the consequences of increased politicization of EU politics, parliamentary behavior of Euroskeptic representatives to the European Parliament, and improving measurement methods for concepts such as policy influence and support for integration.-->

<!-- Methodologically, I focus on Bayesian statistics, machine learning, deep learning and I also apply methods for causal inference with observational data. Currently, I participate in a project on using machine learning techniques to better estimate subnational public opinion. Furthermore, I take part in an effort that applies quantitative text analysis to leverage data from open-ended survey questions collected by development organisations, in a project on forecasting conflict escalation from big data, and an analysis of peace agreement texts to identify common strategies of mediators, their success, and determinants of the negotiation agenda.-->

<!--As part of the mission of the ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre, I instruct members of local government institutions such as law enforcement in R, Python, introductory and advanced statistics. Furthermore, I have experience teaching quantitative methods at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and I advice local government institutions, human rights/civil liberties NGOs and civil society charities on research methodology. -->
